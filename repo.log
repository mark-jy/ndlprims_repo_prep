adjust prims file so it process multi-sequences without having
to end the trial for a particular sequence, this is mainly 
worked out for Saffran's continuous task, but also for any of
the early language paradigms

set up repo and add currentpr.prims to be duplicated with
different task scripts, the currentpr can now rescale to 
long sequences to model, for instance, Saffran's task that
requires continuous presentation of syllables without pauses
